  (category "Drain")
  (description "A person with the Dispelling Touch ability can remove magical effects affecting other individuals or items by touching them with a specific body part (ex: hand, tail, horn, ...). The ability works by transferring the effects from the target to the user. The transferred effects affect the user to a lesser extent than the target while they are dispersing them with their body. The duration of the dispersion varies depending on the dispelled effect and a user need to rest after several minutes of Dispelling Touch use. If the target is affected by several magical effects, the most powerful effects are transfered and dispersed first. A user can only disperse an effect at a time cannot choose the dispersed effect. Dispersing the same effect, or several effect with the same affinity, several times in a row may lead the user to temporary or definitively gain the affinity of the dispersed effect, disabling their Dispelling Touch temporary or definitively,")
